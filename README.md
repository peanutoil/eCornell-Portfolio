This contains the jupyter notebook in which I plan and implement an ML project. I utilized the provided airbnb dataset containing NYC airbnb listings and completed data exploration, data preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation. My project trains two ensemble model (Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forest) to predict the price of an airbnb based on various features such as number of rooms, location, review scores, and more. The project can be viewed as a pdf, or the notebook can be downloaded and run.
